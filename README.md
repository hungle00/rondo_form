# RondoForm

Handle dynamic nested forms, same as Cocoon, but using StimulusJS

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add rondo_form

Or inside the Gemfile add the following

    $ gem 'rondo_form', '~> 0.2.6'

Run the installation task:

    $ rails g rondo_form:install

## Usage

For example, you have `Project` model, which has `has_many` relationship with `Task` model:

```
rails g scaffold Project name:string description:string
rails g model Task description:string done:boolean project:belongs_to
```

You need to add `accepts_nested_attributes_for` to `Project` model:

```
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :tasks, dependent: :destroy
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :tasks, reject_if: :all_blank, allow_destroy: true
end
```

### Sample with SimpleForm

The RondoForm gem adds two helper functions: `link_to_add_association` and `link_to_remove_association`.
The example below illustrates the way to use it.

In your `projects/_form` partial:

``` erb
<%= simple_form_for(@project) do |f| %>

  <div class="form-inputs">
    <%= f.input :name %>
    <%= f.input :description %>
  </div>

  <h3 class="text-xl mt-4">Tasks</h3>
  <div class="my-2" data-controller="nested-rondo" data-nested-rondo-field-class-value="task-field">
    <div data-nested-rondo-target="fieldContain">
      <%= f.simple_fields_for :tasks do |task| %>
        <%= render "task_fields", f: task %>
      <% end %>
    </div>
    <div class="links">
      <%= link_to_add_association "Add Task", f, :tasks %>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="form-actions mt-4">
    <%= f.button :submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

In your `_task_fields` partial:

``` erb
<div class="task-field">
  <%= f.input :description %>
  <%= f.input :done, as: :boolean %>
  <%= link_to_remove_association "Remove Task", f %>
</div>
```

### Controller

Using projects example, in your controller ProjectsController, your params method should look like:
``` ruby
def project_params
  params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, tasks_attributes: [:description, :done, :_destroy, :id])
end
```

params `:_destroy` allow to delete tasks and `:id` allow to update tasks on update action


_Convention_:

- For convention, I named Stimulus controller `nested-rondo`. But you can change the name of Javascript file and the value of `data-controller` to match your purpose.
- `data-nested-rondo-target="fieldContain"` must be added to an element that wraps all nested fields, the new field will be appended to this element.
- `data-nested-rondo-field-class-value` is used to detect the element that needs to be removed. Its value must match the class name of an element that wraps the partial. If you do not declare it, it will default remove the closest parent element.
- The partial added when clicking `link_to_add_association` is named for the association name with the `_fields` suffix. In this example, the partial is named `task_fields`. You can change the partial name by passing the `partial_name` option to `link_to_add_association`.
